                        <h1>Origins</h1>
                        <p>
                            Born as Dessel on the planet Apatros, Bane's early life was marked by hardship and violence.
                            He was a miner who endured abuse and oppression, which fueled his hatred and desire for
                            power.
                            After killing a republic officer in self-defense, Dessel became a fugitive and joined the
                            Sith army as a soldier.
                            Dessel was a very skilled soldier, and knew he had a special gift but wasnt quite sure what
                            it was or what it meant.
                            When Dessel was involed in an incident where he killed a superior, he was set to be executed
                            until a Sith Lord felt his potential and spared him.
                            Taking him into the brotherhood of Darkness as a sith apprentce, Dessel gave himself the
                            name Bane.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Brotherhood of Darkness</h3>
                        <p>
                            Bane initially joined the Brotherhood of Darkness, a Sith organization that sought to
                            overthrow the Jedi and dominate the galaxy.
                            However, he became disillusioned with their methods and lack of true power.
                            Bane believed that the Sith needed to be stronger and more cunning to survive, which led him
                            to challenge the leadership of the Brotherhood.
                            Bane significantly grew in power through many hardships and challenges, but eventually
                            killed the brotherhood's key Dark Lords and manipulated them
                            into a confrontation with the Jedi, which resulted in the Brotherhood's defeat.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Rule of Two</h3>
                        <p>
                            After the fall of the Brotherhood of Darkness, Bane established the Rule of Two, which
                            stated that there could only be two Sith at any given time: a master and an apprentice.
                            The master would embody the power of the dark side, while the apprentice would crave the
                            power and eventually challenge the master for their position.
                            This rule was designed to ensure that the Sith would remain hidden and avoid infighting,
                            allowing them to grow stronger over time.
                        </p>
                        <h3> Tython Incident</h3>
                        <p>
                            Darth Bane and his apprentice, Darth Zannah were involved in a significant conflict on
                            the planet Tython, in which they faced off against five Jedi who were attempting
                            hunt who they beleived was the last Sith Lord, Darth Bane himself. This confrontation ended
                            with
                            the deaths of the 5 jedi, and the framing and death of a family relative to Zannah, who was
                            a past member of the Jedi order, for the murders.
                            Leaving the Jedi to beleive that the Sith were extinct, and allowing Bane and Zannah to
                            continue their work in secret.
                            This incident further solidified the secrecy and cunning that Bane believed was necessary
                            for the survival of the Sith.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Legacy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Darth Bane was killed in combat by his apprentice, Darth Zannah, who succeeded him as the
                            Sith Lord.
                            However, Bane's legacy lived on through the Rule of Two, which was followed by subsequent
                            Sith Lords, including Darth Plaguies and Darth Sidious.
                            Bane's philosophy and teachings influenced the Sith for generations, emphasizing the
                            importance of power, secrecy, and the inevitability of betrayal within the Sith hierarchy
                            which
                            led to the destruction of the Jedi Order and the rise of the Galactic Empire.
