                        <p>
                            This page was created by Isaiah Turner as part of a software engineering practice
                            assignment.
                            What inspired me to choose this topic was my love for StarWars, specifically lore aiming
                            towards Sith history which originated from reading the Darth Bane trilogy by Drew Karpyshyn.
                            Writting up the
                            info for characters felt like a fun little test on my starwars knowledge, although I
                            couldn't
                            include everything
                            or I would have been writing for hours, I tried to include the most important and
                            interesting details about each character.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Home, Details, and add a character page desings were influenced by the dark and gritty
                            aesthetic of the Sith, with a color scheme that reflects their dark nature.
                            I chose this white/black/gold color scheme for the about page as a little suprise switch up
                            for visitors, but also as tribute
                            to the Bane trilogy book cover designs which have a similar color scheme.
                            I wanted to make sure that the design of the website was consistent with the theme of the
                            Sith, and I think I achieved that with the color scheme and overall design choices.
                            I knew that I would have the most fun making this if I chose something I was very passionate
                            about,
                            I can definetely say I enjoyed making this project and learning how to use the tools
                            necessary to make it.
